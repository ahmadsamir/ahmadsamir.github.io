<h1>Shell script to open files related to a git commit</h1>

<p class="post-date">11 Oct 2020</p>

<p>This is a small shell script that I use to open all files related to a commit in git; I find it quite useful when I want to resume working on a local branch.</p>

<p>This is useful if you're not using an IDE or you are working on multiple changes and switch between them.</p>

<p>Anyway, let's get to the script.
</p>
<div>
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
gitPrefix=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

__num=$(git diff --name-only | wc -l)

filter_open() {
$1 | perl -p -e 's!.+!'$gitPrefix'/$&amp;!; s!.+(png|jpeg)$!!' | xargs kate -n &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &
}

if [ -z "$1" -a "$__num" -ge 1 ]; then
filter_open "git diff --name-only"
else
filter_open "git diff HEAD^1 --name-only"
fi
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<code>git rev-parse --show-toplevel</code>: returns the absolute path to the top-level git repo directory</p>

<p><code>git diff --name-only</code>: returns the list of the files that are changed but not committed yet</p>

<p><code>git diff HEAD^1 --name-only</code>: returns the list of files that were changed (committed or not) since the commit before last in the repo</p>

<p><code>perl -p -e 's!.+!'$gitPrefix'/$&amp;!; s!.+(png|jpeg)$!!'</code>: since the git diff commands above return relative paths, I need to prepend $gitPrefix (the output of the <code>git rev-parse --show-toplevel</code> command) to all those relative paths, that's what this perl command does; also it filters out all png/jpeg files (I don't want to edit images with a text editor... it doesn't work)</p>

<p>As you can see, I write hacky bash scripts, I am sure there are ways to make it more elegant, but it works, so.</p>

<p>I have two use cases here:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="li-indent">I started working in a branch, and haven't committed anything yet, so to reopen all the files I've changed in Kate, I use the script without any arguments
</li>
<li class="li-indent">I started working on a branch, committed some stuff, then worked some more but haven't committed that work-in-progress yet, if I want to open all files (those that have been committed in the last commit and those that are still not committed), I call the script with <i>any</i> argument e.g. <code>all</code>.
</li>
<p>
Bonus point, if you save the script as e.g. <code>git-open-files</code> somewhere in your PATH, you can call the script directly (after making it executable) from terminal or you can use it as a git command, i.e. <code>git open-files</code> should work.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

<p>Credits: I had done some online research to get most of those commands (I find it easier to search for a "concept", the after actually finding it, then read the relevant sections of the man pages; sometimes (well, usually) someone, somewhere, had already asked the same question :)), so thanks to all those online resources; e.g. I definitely recall finding the <code>git rev-parse --show-toplevel</code> command in a stack{overflow,exchange} thread.
