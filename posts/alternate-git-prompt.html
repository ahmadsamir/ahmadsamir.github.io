            If you use git on a regular basis, you should look into using git-prompt; there is a file called git-prompt.sh that is shipped with git, the location in your setup varies depending on the Linux distribution you're using, for example in OpenSuse it's /etc/bash_completion.d/git-prompt.sh. The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh">file</a> is of course available in the upstream git repo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the instructions from the top of that file should give you a very useful addition to the prompt of your shell (the file has instructions for BASH and ZSH). However that is not what this blog post is about; this post is about making the Konsole window title more useful, and by that I mean use the window title to show the current dir path and the info from git-prompt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the details, (these instructions are for BASH, but I expect it'll work with other shells with a bit of tweaking?):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Set Konsole to show the title from the shell session on the title bar: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Settings -&gt; Configure Konsole -&gt; General -&gt; Show window title on the title bar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Open <!-- raw HTML omitted -->~/.bashrc<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in your favourite editor and add this:
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
          <ul>
            <li>Next add this small helper function to set the window title (for what this function does see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[1]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->):
            </li>
          </ul><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
          <ul>
            <li>Next add the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->__prompt_set_window_title()<!-- raw HTML omitted --> function to the PROMPT_COMMAND (the prompt command in BASH is executed after each command in the shell), by putting this on a new line in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.bashrc<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:
            </li>
          </ul><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
          <p>
            For what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->history -a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[2]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now when you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to any dir that has a git repo, the name of the branch will be displayed between the square brackets on the title bar, along with a '*' and/or '+' characters to show the status of the repo.
          </p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->prinft '%s %s' "first arg" "second arg"<!-- raw HTML omitted --> printf will replace the first "%s" with "first arg" and the second "%s" with the second arg ...etc
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\e]2;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> starts the escape sequence to set the window title and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> marks the end of it
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->$(__git_ps1 " [ %s ]")<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for this details about this part, read the docs at the beginning of the git-prompt.sh file; this will put the current branch name between square brackets. Note that if you're not in a dir with a git repo, this will show nothing, i.e. an empty string.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->${PWD/#$HOME/~}<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this will put the path of the current dir (i.e. the string stored in the PWD env var) next to the git branch name (and replace <em>/home/username</em> with <em>~</em>), you can remove it if you don't want that behaviour (you'll also want to remove the second "%s" in the <em>printf</em> command).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[2]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->history -a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> adds a very useful feature, which I picked up from Mandriva more than a decade ago (thanks, Colin Guthrie :)), it appends the shell history to the history file after you run each command, which means that if you open a new terminal emulator window, you'll find that the shell history has the last command you ran from any other shell session; without 'history -a', the shell history is only appended in one go to ~/.bash_history (or whatever it's called in your distro) after you close the session). You can remove the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->history -a;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> part if you don't want that behaviour.
