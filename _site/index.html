      <h2><a href="/2021/09/24/firefox-hw-acceleration.html">Firefox and Hardware Acceleration on Linux</a></h2>
      <p>In some Firefox version after 88.0 it looks like they're enabling WebRenderer by default, and it also looks like my hardware (an Nvidia graphics card with the proprietary driver)[1] isn't whitelisted, so what Firefox does is enable &quot;software WebRenderer&quot; instead.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2021/09/09/alternate-git-prompt.html">Get more out of the window title with Konsole</a></h2>
      <p>If you use git on a regular basis, you should look into using git-prompt; there is a file called git-prompt.sh that is shipped with git, the location in your setup varies depending on the Linux distribution you're using, for example in OpenSuse it's /etc/bash_completion.d/git-prompt.sh. The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh">file</a> is of course available in the upstream git repo.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2021/09/07/old-codebase-clang-format.html">When you really appreciate clang-format</a></h2>
      <p>In the KDE repos, a lot of repositories have been formatted using clang-format (almost all of the KDE Frameworks, and IIRC a lot of parts in Plasma, and some apps, and Okular and KActivities (the latter two have had clang-format much longer before the rest of KDE caught up)).</p>

    <li>
      <h2><a href="/2021/08/30/firefox-virtual-desktops.html">Firefox and virtual desktops</a></h2>
      <p>At some point Firefox started remebering which window was open on which desktop, which meant that if you're running KDE or GNOME ...etc and open several Firefox windows on different virtual desktops, when you restart Firefox, each window will be restored to the desktop it was open on. Apparently <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=890125">that started with Firefox 77</a>.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2021/03/20/old-workaround.html">If a workaround "works" for a long time, is it still a workaround?</a></h2>
      <p>I remember back during the KDE3 to KDE4 transition, one feature was broken (or removed then brought back? it's been so long I don't recall exactly), and that is, double clicking the window menu button in the title bar (usually that button is the icon of the application to which that window belongs) would close the window. I was accustomed to using that functionality, both when I used Windows and after I switched to Linux, and it was a bit annoying to see that it suddenly didn't work any more...</p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/10/13/numlock-rebooted.html">NumPad Rebooted</a></h2>
      <p>If you use the PageUp key a lot (e.g. accessing shell history) and instead of hitting PageUp you hit NumLock? and then it happens several times? the solution for me was to remap the NumLock key to become another PageUp.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/10/11/open-files-git-commit.html">Shell script to open files related to a git commit</a></h2>
      <html>
<body>
  <p>This is a small shell script that I use to open all files related to a commit in git; I find it quite useful when I want to resume working on a local branch.</p>
